Description: Provides threshold sweep methods for Qualitative Comparative 
    Analysis (QCA). Implements Condition Threshold Sweep-Single (CTS-S), 
    Condition Threshold Sweep-Multiple (CTS-M), Outcome Threshold Sweep (OTS), 
    and Dual Threshold Sweep (DTS) for systematic exploration of threshold 
    calibration effects on crisp-set QCA results. These methods extend 
    traditional robustness approaches by treating threshold variation as an 
    exploratory tool for discovering causal structures. Built on top of the 
    'QCA' package <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75668-4>, with function arguments 
    following 'QCA' conventions. Based on set-theoretic methods 
    <doi:10.7208/chicago/9780226702797.001.0001> and established robustness 
    protocols <doi:10.1177/00491241211036158>.
